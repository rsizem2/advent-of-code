# README

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) competition. My goal is to complete all the puzzles using my own code, however I may use the subreddit for hints if I am stuck on particular problem. I would like to get a top 100 placement at some point in the future, but completion is the main goal.

## Advent of Code 2021

I found this year more difficult than the previous. I missed a few days towards the end and had to play catch up. My highest placements were in the 14xx range.

## Advent of Code 2020

This was my first time participating in Advent of Code. I had recently taken an online course on algorithms and data structures which helped immensely. I only recall being stuck on a couple of these puzzles to the point that I had to check the solutions thread for help. My overall best placement was under 3000.

## Advent of Code 2015-2019

I plan to go back and do these for practice.
