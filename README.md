# README

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) competition. So far I've participated in 2020 and 2021, but I plan to go back and do previous years for practice/fun. I would like to improve my placements in the future, but I'm just happy to be able to solve all the puzzles.
